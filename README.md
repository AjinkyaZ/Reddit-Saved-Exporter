Client Auth data can be obtained by going to reddit.com/your_username,  
selecting Preferences>Apps>Create another app.  
Once done, click on edit below the app's icon to get the CLIENT_SECRET.  
The CLIENT_ID is located right under the app's name.  

Based on [github.com/export-saved-reddit](https://github.com/csu/export-saved-reddit), which is probably way more powerful/extensive.  
Requires [Praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). To install, just type ```pip install praw``` in your terminal.
