# Reddit Saved Links Exporter
Exports your Reddit saved links to Markdown and JSON  
---
Client auth data can be obtained by going to `reddit.com/<REDDIT_USERNAME>`,   
selecting Preferences > Apps > Create another app.  
Once done, click on edit below the app's icon to get the `CLIENT_SECRET`.  
The `CLIENT_ID` is located right under the app's name.  

Based on [github.com/export-saved-reddit](https://github.com/csu/export-saved-reddit), which is probably way more powerful/extensive.  
Requires [Praw](https://github.com/praw-dev/praw). To install, just type ```pip install praw``` in your terminal.   
Works as of June 2023.
